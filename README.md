# DXTKGui v0.05a

A GUI Framework for DirectX ToolKit.
This developed out of one part not being able to find any existing frameworks and one part me procrastinating on developing the game I'm working on. I had some hacky GUI features (button, dialog box, listbox) and I was bothered by how inflexible and cumbersome they were. So I started this project to make an extensible and re-usable GUI framework (re-usable in my game engines anyway).

### The primary goal of this project was to have GUI controls at my fingertips with minimal hassle. This was never meant to be a professional looking, visually appealing framework, although I am trying to allow every control to have custom, imported graphics.


Included in this project is my custom 2D game engine using DirectX Tool Kit and the test project for trying out all the features.
I literally ripped this out of one of my current projects and I'm in the process of hacking it into a usable state.
This is still a massive mess....
