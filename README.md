# DXTKGui v0.05a

A GUI Framework for DirectXToolKit.
This developed out of one part not being able to find any existing frameworks and one part me procrastinating on developing the game I'm working on. I had some hacky GUI features (button, dialog box, listbox) and I was bothered by how inflexible and cumbersome they were.
